Segment Gait Acceleration Data

This code segments the data of a wearable sensor on the ankle to get the pure walking steps as described in:
Baghdadi, A., Megahed, F. M., Esfahani, E. T., & Cavuoto, L. A. (2018). A machine learning approach to detect changes in gait parameters following a fatiguing occupational task. Ergonomics, 1-14.

The main goal is to extract the following three features using data fusion:
(A) Step Length
(B) Step Height
(C) Step Duration
For all the 15 subjects
